## 🎤 Sample Interview Answers

### **"Tell me about your experience with B2B SaaS products"**

> "I've analyzed Factorial's complete product suite - 27 modules across HR, Finance, and Operations. I understand how to position complex SaaS products by focusing on business outcomes, not features. I've created demo frameworks that show ROI in the first 10 minutes, and I know how to handle technical objections by connecting features to business value."

### **"How would you train our sales team on Operations products?"**

> "I'd start with the tools I've already created - buying signals cheat sheets, bundle comparison guides, and ROI calculators. Then I'd build a certification program with three levels: Foundation (basic product knowledge), Advanced (consultative selling), and Expert (complex enterprise deals). I'd measure success through demo quality, close rates, and customer satisfaction."

### **"What market insights can you provide for Portugal?"**

> "I've identified that Portuguese SMBs are cost-conscious and relationship-driven. They prefer modular solutions over complex bundles. The biggest opportunity is expanding existing Factorial clients - they already trust the platform and have data in the system. I've calculated that a 25% attach rate on Operations products could generate significant additional revenue."

### **"How would you improve our attach rate?"**

> "I'd implement a systematic approach: First, identify clients with Operations pain signals during discovery. Second, create natural upsell paths from Core to Operations. Third, train reps on when and how to present Operations products. Fourth, measure and optimize based on what works. I've already mapped the most effective upsell sequences."
